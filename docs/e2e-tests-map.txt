All End-to-End tests and where to find them
============================================

E2e tests take long to run. Therefore, to save time, a single e2e test sometimes tests
many things. But then it's hard to give it a name that describes everything it does. Instead
here you'll find a map of all things that are e2e tested, and in which files. A single file
might be listed at many places in the tree, if it tests different things.

(ABC123) means see-elsewhere-in-this-file = search for ABC123 in this file.
[ABC123] = search all files everywhere

Run all tests in different resolutions? Desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile.
